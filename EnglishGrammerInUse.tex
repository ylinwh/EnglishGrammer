    \section{Present continuous(I am)}
    \textbf{I am doing something}=I'm in the middle of doing it; I've started doing it and I haven't
    finished. 

    Sometimes the action is not happening at the time of speaking. For example: \\
    Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says: "I'm reading a really good book at the moment.
    It's about a man who ..."

    Steve is not reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he started it, but has not finished it yet.
    He is in the middle of reading it.

    You can use the present continuous with \textbf{today} / \textbf{this week} / \textbf{this year} etc. (periods around now):
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*:]
        \item You're working hard today. (not You work hard today)
        \item Yes, I have a lot to do.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*):]
        \item The company I work for isn't doing so well \textbf{this year}.
        \item I want to lose weight, so this week I am not eating lunch.
    \end{enumerate}
